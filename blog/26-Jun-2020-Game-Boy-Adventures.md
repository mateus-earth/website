## Intro

I always have being a very big fan of the Nintendo's Game Boy system.
When I was young me and my brother got one for christmas from dad
and it was more the awesome ;D

I can almost remember as if was today, we went for a neighbor town,
close to our city - because our city didn't have big stores that
sell those kinda things back then - and got a **clear purple**
Game Boy Color with **Pokemon Gold**.

It felt sweet and it was **AMAZING** to have that system.
I played a lot of Pokemon, but I think that my favorite game was
Mario Tennis.

## El Jamon Volador

When I was in Portugal, me and my friend [monty](https://montyontherun.itch.io/)
and Livia attended a retro conference in the lovely city of Lourinh√£, when I had the opportunity
to buy an Game Boy Advanced SP for a very, very good price.

Back then I was excited with the device again and decided to start
to learn how to program to the platform. Since I had no experience
programming for it I thought that a simple game would be the best
way to get the speed on the development and decided to create a
small flappy bird clone!

This is the way that
[El Jamon Volador](https://stdmatt.com/games/el_jamon_volador.html)
was born.

While developing it was really nice, the game is really, really simple.
It reached my expectations - of course things always can be better -
but I think that I finished a funny game for the constraints that
I have back then.


## Next Games?

Almost 9 months passed since I made the **El Jamon Volador**, and a lot
of things happened meanwhile - I think that the most big ones are:

- I came to live in Belarus - which was not a  easy task, but more on that in another post.
- I started to work at Wargaming.
- I created (and finished) other games like
    [Simple Snake](https://stdmatt.com/games/simple_snake.html),
    [Nuclear Rain](https://stdmatt.com/games/nuclear_rain.html),
    [Color Grid](https://stdmatt.com/games/color_grid.html).
- And I'm working on in 2 or 3 games **:)** - while having another 2 or 3 stalled **:'(**

But now I think that too much time has passed, and I'm really, really
eager to develop something to Game Boy again. I'm already thinking in some
game ideas to create and have some key points in mind:

- The game should be simple and doable - I have limited time to invest on it.
- It must be more polished and _"professional"_ than **El Jamon Volador**.
- I want to have full control of the assets creation this time - previously I had used
free assets for some of the content.
- I want to use new features of the Game Boy and expand the ones that I had used before.

## After that?

Well for now I'm planning to make 2 game with the _"specs"_ that I described
above - I'll try to make a post just about it later - and after I finished
them stop for a while to write down and document about what I learned in the
process - So other people can benefit from it as well.

After that I really don't quite know. I know that I want to continue
creating games for this system - but there's a lot of other ones that
I have interest as well, like the NES and the Genesis.

Let's do one step at time, iterate quickly and course correct on the way!

Let's have fun...

<h1>Game Boy Adventures</h2>

<!-- tags: game-boy, dev, retro-programming -->

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I always have being a very big fan of the Nintendo's Game Boy system.</p>
<p>When I was young me and my brother got one for christmas from dad</p>
<p>and it was more the awesome ;D</p>
<p>I can almost remember as if was today, we went for a neighbor town,</p>
<p>close to our city - because our city didn't have big stores that</p>
<p>sell those kinda things back then - and got a <strong>clear purple</strong></p>
<p>Game Boy Color with <strong>Pokemon Gold</strong>.</p>
<p>It felt sweet and it was <strong>AMAZING</strong> to have that system.</p>
<p>I played a lot of Pokemon, but I think that my favorite game was</p>
<p>Mario Tennis.</p>
<h2>El Jamon Volador</h2>
<p>When I was in Portugal, me and my friend <a href="https://montyontherun.itch.io/">monty</a></p>
<p>and Livia attended a retro conference in the lovely city of Lourinh√£, when I had the opportunity</p>
<p>to buy an Game Boy Advanced SP for a very, very good price.</p>
<p>Back then I was excited with the device again and decided to start</p>
<p>to learn how to program to the platform. Since I had no experience</p>
<p>programming for it I thought that a simple game would be the best</p>
<p>way to get the speed on the development and decided to create a</p>
<p>small flappy bird clone!</p>
<p>This is the way that</p>
<p><a href="https://stdmatt.com/games/el_jamon_volador.html">El Jamon Volador</a></p>
<p>was born.</p>
<p>While developing it was really nice, the game is really, really simple.</p>
<p>It reached my expectations - of course things always can be better -</p>
<p>but I think that I finished a funny game for the constraints that</p>
<p>I have back then.</p>
<h2>Next Games?</h2>
<p>Almost 9 months passed since I made the <strong>El Jamon Volador</strong>, and a lot</p>
<p>of things happened meanwhile - I think that the most big ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I came to live in Belarus - which was not a  easy task, but more on that in another post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started to work at Wargaming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I created (and finished) other games like</p>
<p><a href="https://stdmatt.com/games/simple_snake.html">Simple Snake</a>,</p>
<p><a href="https://stdmatt.com/games/nuclear_rain.html">Nuclear Rain</a>,</p>
<p><a href="https://stdmatt.com/games/color_grid.html">Color Grid</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I'm working on in 2 or 3 games <strong>:)</strong> - while having another 2 or 3 stalled <strong>:'(</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But now I think that too much time has passed, and I'm really, really</p>
<p>eager to develop something to Game Boy again. I'm already thinking in some</p>
<p>game ideas to create and have some key points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The game should be simple and doable - I have limited time to invest on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It must be more polished and <em>"professional"</em> than <strong>El Jamon Volador</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to have full control of the assets creation this time - previously I had used</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>free assets for some of the content.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to use new features of the Game Boy and expand the ones that I had used before.</li>
</ul>
<h2>After that?</h2>
<p>Well for now I'm planning to make 2 game with the <em>"specs"</em> that I described</p>
<p>above - I'll try to make a post just about it later - and after I finished</p>
<p>them stop for a while to write down and document about what I learned in the</p>
<p>process - So other people can benefit from it as well.</p>
<p>After that I really don't quite know. I know that I want to continue</p>
<p>creating games for this system - but there's a lot of other ones that</p>
<p>I have interest as well, like the NES and the Genesis.</p>
<p>Let's do one step at time, iterate quickly and course correct on the way!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Let's have fun...</p>
<p>:D</p>

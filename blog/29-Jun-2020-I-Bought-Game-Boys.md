## Intro

Like I said before ([here](./26-Jun-2020-Game-Boy-Adventures.html)), I'm super excited
with the Game Boy development that I'm doing lately!

Things are going super nicely - besides some difficulties regarding making sound
to happen, but I'll try to discuss that in another post - and I'm quite happy
with the progress that I'm achieving on it.

So happy that I decided to buy some Game Boys again so I can test the games on
the real hardware - and no I didn't have a way to flash the game to the cartridges yet,
but I'm exploring some options.

So this post is just to show my new babies - Look how cute they are!

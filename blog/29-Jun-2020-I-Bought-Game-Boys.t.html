<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Like I said before (<a href="./26-Jun-2020-Game-Boy-Adventures.html">here</a>), I'm super excited</p>
<p>with the Game Boy development that I'm doing lately!</p>
<p>Things are going super nicely - besides some difficulties regarding making sound</p>
<p>to happen, but I'll try to discuss that in another post - and I'm quite happy</p>
<p>with the progress that I'm achieving on it.</p>
<p>So happy that I decided to buy some Game Boys again so I can test the games on</p>
<p>the real hardware - and no I didn't have a way to flash the game to the cartridges yet,</p>
<p>but I'm exploring some options.</p>
<p>So this post is just to show my new babies - Look how cute they are!</p>

Well, so finally that The Smiths song "So for once in my life, let me get what I want" is true for me...<br>
I'm having a wonderful, amazing, fulfilling and joyful experience
<br><br>

I'm doing fine at work - Like everything in life it can be improved, but it's nice - my personal life
is quite stable, I have the friends that I ever wanted to have and I'm hearing music even when I ain't
wearing earphones.
<br><br>

I'm learning so much, each and every day with a lot of people and this is amazing. Every night I go
to bed with something that is completely new to me. Every night I go to bed knowing that I did
my best to let people around me happy - and achieving this as well most of the time.
<br><br>

I'm the best version of my self - but there's so many things to improve, there's so many things
to learn, to share, to live, to experience, to enjoy.
<br><br>

Life is beautiful for me right now, I want to help the other people have beautiful life as well.
<br><br>

I'm fucking happy and I think that the things that I left behind was just to open space
to me embrace the new things!
<br><br>

All this music, all this senses, all this tastes, all this ideas, all this challenges,
all this people, all this places! I'm glad to live right now!
<br><br>

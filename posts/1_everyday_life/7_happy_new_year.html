The new year has begun and with it a set of 365 new opportunities to make
a difference in your and everybody's life. <br><br>

I had the pleasure to spent the New Years Eve with Adeel and Santiago watching
the fireworks at Pra√ßa do Comercio in Lisbon. It was an amazing experience
that I'll carry forever in my heart.
<br><br>

I never saw something quite amazing like that fireworks (they were so close),
had such good company and be a such good mood.
<br><br>

It was more than awesome, it was almost perfect - I'm really glad to had
this experience at this point of my life.

But the most amazing thing happened after me and Adeel came home - Santiago
left a little bit early!
<br><br>

We had a deep conversation about our goals, our struggles, what is "easy"
to achieve and what is very hard to do so. It was amazing since a lot of things
were very, very similar between both of us. (We need to remember that me and
Adeel have totally different cultures, backgrounds and everything...)
<br><br>

After long hours chatting about that, smoking cigarettes and drinking a nice
coffee we decided to help each other in achieve what we decided to achieve this
year. So besides to the things that I need to do, I need to be a <i>"role model"</i>
for him and vice versa.
<br><br>

I really glad to have Adeel as a friend! I always wanted to have this kind
of friendship with someone. A friendship that cares about the other, that
help the other grow up, to help the other evolve, to help the other to become
a better person.
<br><br>

Oh gosh... yeah my celling knows how I wanted to have something that is
constructive towards someone and have this back to me also!
<br><br>

I'm happy ;D

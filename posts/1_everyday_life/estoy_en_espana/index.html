    YA! Can you believe it? I'm at Spain with Daniel and Livia and we're heading
    to Albacete to join the RetroAlba retro-computing convention tomorrow.
    <br><br>

    I know that this sounds silly, but anyways for me it's quite an achievement.
    This is the first trip that I do outside Brazil by myself! <br>
    I mean, I went to Portugal but this was a "Miniclip thing"... of course it
    was really nice but I'll consider this trip as my very first one from my own.
    <br><br>

    It's being quite amazing actually! Daniel and Livia are really nice people
    and I really like to stay with them ;D We're doing great up to now, besides
    our best efforts to speak spanish, it's being easier to get stuff done in
    english ;DDDD
    <br><br>

    We're at Madrid right now, at a nice coffee shop near the train station...
    just chilling a bit and killing time until the train to Albacete is ready!
    <br><br>

    I'm quite, quite happy!
    <br><br>

    Let's continue this adventure and check how nice it will be!
    <br><br>

    <b>To be continued...</b>

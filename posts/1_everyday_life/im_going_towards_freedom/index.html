    I'm writing this post about something that happened last friday (Dec 21) and
    made me extremely happy. I felt - and I'm feeling - so happy and so complete
    by what happened that I consider that day a pivotal point at my life.
    <br> <br>

    I had some of those moments before - unfortunately I don't have the specific
    dates - and everytime that something like that happens you know that you
    are on the right track towards a complete freedom.
    <br><br>

    Well, what so special happened? <br>
    People told me that my <i>"ex-wife"</i> is in a serious relationship.
    <br><br>

    Yep, this is it. I'm very, very happy about it.
    <br><br>

    Fortune gave me the opportunity to had the relationship with her before,
    for a reason it didn't work and we broke. I tried to act with virtue in
    all of my actions, sometimes I failed, sometimes I excel, but everytime I learned
    and I improved.
    <br><br>

    I'm a really better person by the precise fact that we broke like we did.
    That situation taught me a lot and made me more stoic than before.
    <br><br>

    So when I knew that I was complete happy, I'm in complete control of my mind
    on that subject and like Epictetus taught us - <b>a man is free, only when he controls his mind.</b>
    <br><br>

    By this, I'm completely grateful to her. Without this sequence of events that
    brought us to here I'm perhaps wouldn't be able to be what I'm right now.
    <br><br>

    I don't know about you, but be free is the most important thing to be. <br>
    Now nothing more can hurt me, only if I let it hurt me! I know that this is
    only the begging, but <b>I'm going towards the freedom</b>

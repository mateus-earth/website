    Like I said in
        <a href="../../../posts/1_everyday_life/songs_listening_november_2018/index.html">here</a>
    I would try to capture all the songs that I'm currently listening and the
    sensations that they brings to me.
    <br>
    <br>

    This will let me go back in the future and have more context about what I
    was feeling at this present time and let me understand myself better.
    <br>
    <br>

    So here is the second part of this November ;D
    <br> <br> <br>

    <!-- #1-->
    <p>
    <b>#1</b>, Well I really get into Synthwave and I'm loving it. This kind of music
    really keeps me focused on what I'm tyring to focus at the moment and really don't
    distract me!
    <br>
    <br>
    It's a blessing to work listening those playlists ;D
    </p>

    <!-- #2 -->
    <p>
    <b>#2, </b>Before I was listening this song thing in another person, but since
        last week or so I really rethought its meaning and now I really believe
        that it fits to me as a glove - Which is unfortunate as hell, and I need
        to do something about it.
        <br>
        Unfortunately I got distracted and deviated from my path - at least the
        path that I want to follow - so now I'm currently thinking about it
        and checking what made me do that and how I can improve to get back
        in the way that I want to do things.
        <br>
        This kinda sucks, but I'm sure that I'll get back, I need to analyze,
        scrutinize and then improve myself. Better now than later and better
        know that I'm wrong in some aspect than live in the ignorance forever.

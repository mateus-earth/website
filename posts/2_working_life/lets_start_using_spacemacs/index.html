    Like everybody I always heard about Emacs and VI, this can't be different since both of them are the most
    enduring text editors still around and both have legions of fans (and detractors)
    <br> <br>

    While I'm not here to judge any of them - actually I can't, even if I want, since I don't have any prior experience
    with neither of them besides some knowledge to let me make very, very quick edits with VI when I'm <i>"ssh'ing"</i>
    into remote hosts...
    <br><br>

    Again, like everybody I always heard about the superior capabilities of VI and how extensible Emacs could be,
    and how when you get used to them, they become an editor for a life time. This triggered me! I mean, an editor
    for life time is amazing, no matter where you are, you always will get something that you are used to and will
    get productive in a blink of eye.
    <br><br>

    I mean, this is a very compelling reason to actually try those editors and check if this is actually true,
    so I decided to give a try!
    <br><br><br>

    In verbatim: "Spacemacs is a new way to experience Emacs -- a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on
    ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.".
    <br><br>

    For what I could understand, this project brings the VI modal editing (<s>which I'm struggling with right now</s>)
    and the extensibility of Emacs together into a nice package.
    <br><br>

    This seems a perfect way to try my way into those editors, I'll have an Emacs that I can edit like a VI!
    There's a way to make Spacemacs edits like an Emacs as well, but the authors of the project don't encourage this.
    <br><br><br>

    <hr>

    &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#install">Installed Spacemacs.</a> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - <a href="https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements">Installed Karabiner Elements.</a> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - Changed my <code>Escape</code> key to the <code>Caps Lock</code> <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - Started to edit some files with this setup. <br>
    <br><br>

    The installation was pretty smoothly and everything almost works out of the box. I had to use the <code>
    --insecure</code> flag to Spacemacs be actually able to install the packages, but besides that everything
    works pretty well.
    <br><br>

    The default installation came with a nice "filesystem" tree called <b>neotree</b> which was my main complaint
    against the vanilla version of Emacs and VI. The neotree seems pretty capable and already grabbed a piece
    of my heart when it offered to create a directory instead a plain file just because I ended the filename
    with a forward slash - How sweet <3
    <br> <br> <br>

    A <b>very</b>, <b>very</b> steep curve. The VI way to edit text is not easy to get used to. This isn't
    a thing of <i>"bad x good"</i> or something like that, it's just the way that you're used to thing about edit
    text.
    <br><br>

    My personal background was always with IDEs and this kind of editors, so the modal editing requires
    me to think about it, which isn't great at all - So I can think that my productive will reduce for
    quite some time, until I get used to this way of editing.
    <br><br>

    But, there are some nice stuff already! Firstly you almost don't need to put your hands off the keyboard
    which is great - I think that when I get used to all the commands this will be an absolutely, insanely
    way to edit code. Finally the mouse support is very nice (So I can continue use it if I needed) and
    the default theme is pretty nice.

    Well I'll try very hard to edit everything that I can in the Spacemacs. If I think that my productivity
    will not drop that hard I'll try to use it at Miniclip as well.
    <br><br>

    I'll try to find a spellchecker package, since my mother tongue isn't English I do a lot of silly mistakes
    - more than I would like to admit.
    <br><br>

    Finally I'll try to document the process the best I could, so if everything goes well I'll be able
    to help other people to switch to Spacemacs as well!

This week I did my sixth talk at Miniclip! It was about
"move semantics and values categories" in C++.
<br><br>

I'm quite happy with the feedback (which was positive) but yet there're
some places that I can really improve, both the presentation and the information
presented - And that's a good thing, if you think that you can't improve anymore
this is the real danger, because or you're a fool to think that are perfect or
didn't grabbed enough feedback.
<br><br>

But what makes me feel very, very happy is the possibility of give this talks
to the people there, I mean all Miniclip employees are very, very competent
and when they spare some of their time just to see you talking about some
subject is very rewarding.
<br><br>

I remember my "early career" back to Microsoft Innovation Center (MicBH) and
as Microsoft Student Partner (MSP) and back then I was used to give a lot of
talks in a lot of places - Was part of the internship in MicBH and MSP.
<br><br>

So I learned how to really like to share information and be part of the
learning of other people. The joy and care that I did put on each of that
lectures really help to shape the way that I care about spreading knowledge.
<br><br>

Unfortunately after I quit both MSP and MicBH I never quite had a real
opportunity to talk again. I could tried to make this happens but to be
honest I wasn't willing to do for real.
<br><br>

So when I entered Miniclip and I heard that if I want I could propose subjects
for talks and if they are chosen I could present them, my mind was blown!
I really, really want to get back giving talks again.
<br><br>

So there I'm with six months of Miniclip and six talks presented. <br>
Some of them were "lighting talks", somewhat to 15-25 minutes and some of
them were normal ones, 1+ hours.
<br><br>

Nevertheless each one of them was special to make, to present, to get feedback,
to exchange ideas and everything.

<br><br>
<s>While I don't know yet if I can share them with public - I think that's ok
but I'll talk to my manager to be sure - but if everything is ok to share,
I'll post all of them here ;D</s>
<br><br>

<b>Update:</b><br>
Yes, I can share them ;D You can find all of them <a href="../2018_lectures_at_miniclip/index.html">here!</a>

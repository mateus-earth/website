    <br><br><br>

    This week I did my sixth talk at Miniclip! It was about
    "move semantics and values categories" in C++.
    <br><br>

    I'm quite happy with the feedback (which was positive) but yet there're
    some places that I can really improve, both the presentation and the information
    presented - And that's a good thing, if you think that you can't improve anymore
    this is the real danger, because or you're a fool to think that are perfect or
    didn't grabbed enough feedback.
    <br><br>

    But what makes me feel very, very happy is the possibility of give this talks
    to the people there, I mean all Miniclip employees are very, very competent
    and when they spare some of their time just to see you talking about some
    subject is very rewarding.
    <br><br>

    I remember my "early career" back to Microsoft Innovation Center (MicBH) and
    as Microsoft Student Partner (MSP) and back then I was used to give a lot of
    talks in a lot of places - Was part of the internship in MicBH and MSP.
    <br><br>

    So I learned how to really like to share information and be part of the
    learning of other people. The joy and care that I did put on each of that
    lectures really help to shape the way that I care about spreading knowledge.
    <br><br>

    Unfortunately after I quit both MSP and MicBH I never quite had a real
    opportunity to talk again. I could tried to make this happens but to be
    honest I wasn't willing to do for real.
    <br><br>

    So when I entered Miniclip and I heard that if I want I could propose subjects
    for talks and if they are chosen I could present them, my mind was blown!
    I really, really want to get back giving talks again.
    <br><br>

    So there I'm with six months of Miniclip and six talks presented. <br>
    Some of them were "lighting talks", somewhat to 15-25 minutes and some of
    them were normal ones, 1+ hours.
    <br><br>

    Nevertheless each one of them was special to make, to present, to get feedback,
    to exchange ideas and everything.

    <br><br>
    While I don't know yet if I can share them with public - I think that's ok
    but I'll talk to my manager to be sure - but if everything is ok to share,
    I'll post all of them here ;D

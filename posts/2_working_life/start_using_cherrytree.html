<!-- Title: Start using CherryTree -->

I started to using a very cute and useful note taking program called
<a href="https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/">CherryTree</a>
<br>

<p>
    My idea was to start to become more organized and build a kind of library
    of knowledge for myself.

    This way, over time, I'll have a single point to go to research things that I want to.
</p>

<p>
    Before that I tried to organize my things into the browser's bookmark system,
    but the major drawback that I found is, while is very easy to add new things -
    too easy actually that it becomes really hard to scrutinize what should be added or not -
    to search things that I added or to review things quickly the experience is very poor.
</p>

<p>
    Actually I started to using Microsoft's OneNote for the task, and while the
    program itself is very cool, the proprietary nature of it makes me feel jailed
    into it.
    <br><br>
    I mean, I can't:
    <ul>
        <li>Self host my notes.</li>
        <li>Export my notes in formats that are readable by other programs.</li>
        <li>Easily make backups of the contents.</li>
        <li>And it is tied with a Microsoft Account - And I don't want no one reading my stuff.</li>
    </ul>
    So was clear the One Note was not a place to go for me.
</p>

<p>
    I decide to go for CherryTree instead.
    It's a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">FREE SOFTWARE </a> package - which is
    paramount for me.
    <br><br>

    The cool things that I've found up to know are:
    <ul>
        <li>It's Free software.</li>
        <li>Very, very customizable for my needs.</li>
        <li>Really stable - Not a single crash in one week of usage. (OneNote crashed twice)</li>
        <li>Save the notes in plain text (xml) or sqlite3 databases - I'll talk about that in another post, cause this is double edge sword.</li>
        <li>Let me embed any kind of content of the notes - So I can put images, audios, etc.</li>
        <li>The project is active in github - which is nice because I can rely on new features and bug fixes over time.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    For now, the experience is being quite smooth. I'm really enjoying it and I truly think that it does
    what it promises to do so. No more no less.
</p>
<p>
    There's some small bits that I don't quite like, but still, I prefer to continue to use it and check
    if something that is inherently bad about the software or if is me that isn't understanding the
    thing itself. So I'll continue to use that and with more experience adn millage talk about in future.

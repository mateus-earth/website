I'm writing this post about something that happened last friday (Dec 21) and
made me extremely happy. I felt - and I'm feeling - so happy and so complete
by what happened that I consider that day a pivotal point at my life.
<br> <br>

I had some of those moments before - unfortunately I don't have the specific
dates - and everytime that something like that happens you know that you
are on the right track towards a complete freedom.
<br><br>

Well, what so special happened? <br>
People told me that my <i>"ex-wife"</i> is in a serious relationship.
<br><br>

Yep, this is it. I'm very, very happy about it.
<br><br>

Fortune gave me the opportunity to had the relationship with her before,
for a reason it didn't work and we broke. I tried to act with virtue in
all of my actions, sometimes I failed, sometimes I excel, but everytime I learned
and I improved.
<br><br>

I'm a really better person by the precise fact that we broke like we did.
That situation taught me a lot and made me more stoic than before.
<br><br>

So when I knew that I was complete happy, I'm in complete control of my mind
on that subject and like Epictetus taught us - <b>a man is free, only when he controls his mind.</b>
<br><br>

By this, I'm completely grateful to her. Without this sequence of events that
brought us to here I'm perhaps wouldn't be able to be what I'm right now.
<br><br>

I don't know about you, but be free is the most important thing to be. <br>
Now nothing more can hurt me, only if I let it hurt me! I know that this is
only the begging, but <b>I'm going towards the freedom</b>

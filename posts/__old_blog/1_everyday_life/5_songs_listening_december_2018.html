To be completely honest, I'm listening the same stuff from november. <br>
That's it, nothing new... but let's let a question to think about...
<br><br>

If I'm comfortable with some situation, should I strive to get out of my
zone of comfort and discover new ways, things, people, etc or should I
stay with brings me more comfort? <br>
If I should get out, there's any intrinsic value in get out of the comfort zone
by the sake of get out by itself? If I should stay, there's a risk to get used
to not change and become stagnated?

Well, I gave another talk at Miniclip! This time was an argument to inline our code to make it
more manageable and easier to understand, modify and reason about.
<br><br>

Actually this talk was quite simple to make, I just need to adapt the Carmack's email to the <b>id</b> employees
and try to make it reflect our reality here at Miniclip. <br>

It was quite, quite nice! Everybody have an opinion about the code should be and that stuff... the talk generated
a lot of heated discussions and a lot of arguments both agreeing and against the original argument!
<br><br>

This was **exactly** what I meant to do when I was thinking about of this talk. I do not want that people follow
blindly and even to agree. I want discussion, I want arguments, I want that people really understand the whys and
the hows and start to question about some things that are considered "OK" but in really can be quite harmful if
you just do without thinking about...
<br><br>

The feedback was **awesome** and I'm quite pleased with the result!
<br><br>

With this talk my count went up to <B>SEVEN TALKS</B> since I came to Portugal!<br>
Amazing!!!!
